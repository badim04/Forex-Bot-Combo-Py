Straddle with hedging

So in the straddle strategy below, I want to add just one more thing
I want to add a hedging strategy if it would trigger both buy and sell pending orders (buystop and sellstop) triggers. then when either triggers then the other one should have a lot of times 40% more than the open other one

For example
I take a buystop and sellstop of 1 lot each, if the sellstop triggers then the lot for the buystop is increased 1.4 lot now (40% more than the triggered sell) now if the direction should go back in the direction of the sell then another sell is opened at that same position of the first one but with a total of 40% more than the buy (40% more than 1.4 lot which is 1.96 lot in total), we already have 1lot open so it would be 0.96 lot for the second sell, and if it should go back the other way again then it keeps opening new trades by those two lines until a tp is hit for them all 

hedging
Okay here it is
If first trade is a buy.....it cant be both
First trade is a buy, lot is 0.01
2nd trade has to be a sell, lot is 40% more than the buy(0.01) so that's 0.014 lot
3rd trade has to be a buy, lot is 40% more than the sell(0.014) so that's 0.0196 lot but we already have 0.01 lot open so this one is (0.0196 - 0.01) which is 0.0096 lot
4th trade has to be a sell, 40% more than buys (0.0196) that's 0.02744 but we have an open trade of 0.014 so this one's lot would be 0.02744 - 0.014 which would be 0.01344
And so on


1st trade - buy lot 0.01
2nd trade - sell lot 0.014
3rd trade - buy lot 0.0096
4th trade - sell lot 0.01344
and so on

This is the calculation i want and need

Buy: 0.01
Sell: 0.014
